<h1>Unit Testing Project</h1>
<p>This project was developed by <strong>Hamlet Pirazan</strong> and <strong>Giancarlo Cabrera</strong>. The main goal is to demonstrate the use of unit tests in different scenarios and data types.</p>

<h2>Tests Conducted</h2>
<p>Below are the tests conducted in this project:</p>

<h3>Array Test</h3>
<p>In this test, we verify the expected behavior when working with arrays. This includes manipulating elements within the array and validating its length.</p>

<h3>Division Test</h3>
<p>This test focuses on the division operation. We verify that the operation is performed correctly and that zero division cases are handled appropriately.</p>

<h3>Multiplication Test</h3>
<p>In the multiplication test, we validate that the multiplication operation works as expected, including cases with zero and negative numbers.</p>

<h3>String Test</h3>
<p>The string test verifies the behavior when manipulating strings. This includes concatenating strings and manipulating individual characters.</p>

<h3>Sum Test</h3>
<p>Finally, the sum test verifies that the sum operation works correctly. This includes cases with positive, negative, and zero numbers.</p>

<p>We hope this project serves as a useful introduction to unit testing and its importance in software development.</p>
